Things Still ToDo:

Create the bucket - Currently, the system just quits the deployment if the bucket doesn't exist.  I want the option of creating the bucket,
but I couldn't find it in the aws-sdk-php documentation.  I'll figure it out, though.

Create DNS Record and Permission Policy - You still need to create the Route53 DNS record manually.  Same goes for the permissions on the bucket.

Config Option For Bucket Name - I just haven't gotten around to it, but I want the name of the bucket to sit in the configuration file.
